Purpose: 
In order to make students within a team be more compatible with each other, this system provides a tool that automatically matches students together into teams based on their compatibility.
For any given project, the goal of the cuPID system is to generate a set of teams. Each team is made up of project partners (students) that best match each other in terms of compatibility.


So far, the following features are completed:
• the cuPID student user’s ability to add him/herself to a selected project

• the student user’s ability to edit his/her own project partner profile

• the administrator user’s ability to create and edit projects

• the administrator user’s ability to modify the configuration values required by the PPID algorithm
